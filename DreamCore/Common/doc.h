 * \section Architecture Architecture
 * This section will describe the key concepts used when working with Dream.
 *
 * \subsection Definition-vs-Runtime
 * Dream separates data into two domains.
 *
 * \subsubsection Definition Definition
 * Objects are used to describe the Project as it was saved. For example,
 * initial transforms, physics properties, visibility, etc.
 * * \link octronic::dream::Definition \endlink
 *
 * \subsubsection Runtime Runtime
 * Objects will change their properties as a Scene runs. This means that the
 * current state of the scene no longer matches it's initial state. Runtime
 * objects are used to store the current state of a scene, allowing variables to
 * be modified whilst Definition objects always retain the Scene's initial state.
 * * \link octronic::dream::Runtime \endlink
 *
 * \subsection Project Project
 * Project objects are the highest level of object in Dream. A Project consists
 * primarily of a ProjectDefinition and ProjectRuntime. A ProjectDefinition
 * defines a Project, it's Scenes, Entities and Assets. On disk a Project is
 * saved as a json file and an accompanying set of assets directories. These
 * directories store any data (Texture/Font/3D/Audio/etc.) required to run the
 * Project
 * * \link octronic::dream::Project \endlink
 * * \link octronic::dream::ProjectDefinition \endlink
 * * \link octronic::dream::ProjectRuntime \endlink
 *
 * \subsection Scenes Scenes
 * A Project contains one or more Scenes that are to be displayed. A Scene is composed of one
 * or more Entities. A Scene may for example represent a level, environment or stage within
 * your application.
 * * \link octronic::dream::SceneDefinition \endlink
 * * \link octronic::dream::SceneRuntime \endlink
 *
 * \subsection Entities Entities
 * Entities are used to construct a 'Scenegraph' that describes the relationship of objects
 * within the Scene. A Scene has a single 'Root' Entity with n-children. Entities are
 * arranged within a parent-child relationship tree, through which they can inherit their transformation.
 * Each Entity is assigned zero or more 'Assets Definitions' to instanciate at runtime.
 * * \link octronic::dream::EntityDefinition \endlink
 * * \link octronic::dream::EntityRuntime \endlink
 *
 * \subsection Assets Assets
 * A Project will contain numerous Assets. An Asset describes something that can
 * be added into a Scene, such as a 3D Model, Audio Clip, Spline Path, etc.
 * (full list below).
 * * \link octronic::dream::AssetDefinition \endlink
 * * \link octronic::dream::AssetRuntime \endlink
 *
 * \subsubsection AssetDefinitions Asset Definitions
 * AssetDefinition objects are used to define an Asset's initial properties.
 * They are defined once at the Project level and can be reused multiple times
 * within a Screen to create AssetRuntime objects. These AssetRuntimes are
 * then assigned to Entities within a Scene. AssetDefinition objects are
 * defined at the Project level so that they can be shared by Entities.
 *
 * These are the types of Asset available in Dream.

 *      * \link octronic::dream::TextureRuntime \endlink
 *
 * \section Memory Management Policy
 *
 * Dream uses vector<unique_ptr<Type>> to store objects generated at runtime. This
 * is used instead of plain vector<Type>, because resizing the vector invalidates
 * references to it's contained objects. unique_ptr references remain the same, as
 * the unique_ptr wrapper may move, but the underlying object will not.
 *
 * All types are passed around by Type&, reference_wrapper<Type>, or optional<reference_wrapper<Type>>.
 * To force object resolution before use (aka null-checking).
 *
 * Dream will NEVER return a nullptr. Choosing instead to throw an exception, or
 * in the case of an optional<reference_wrapper<Type>>, returning a nullopt,
 * which can be handled by the caller.
 *
 * SharedAssetRuntimes are owned by their respective Cache Objects.
 * DiscreteAssetRuntimes are owned by their EntityRuntime.
 * ScenesRuntimes are owned by the ProjectRuntime.
 * ProjectRuntimes are owned by the ProjectContext.
